# Quick Deploy Guide

Since you need to deploy your Next.js portfolio to GitHub Pages quickly, here are two options:

## Option 1: Manual Deploy (Quickest)

For now, you can keep your old static site running while we fix the build issues. The Next.js version will work locally at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Option 2: Use Vercel (Recommended - Easiest)

Since GitHub Pages has limitations with Next.js, I recommend deploying to **Vercel** instead:

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Next.js portfolio"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your `syal00.github.io` repository
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Your site will be live at:**
   - `https://your-project.vercel.app` (free subdomain)
   - Or connect your custom domain

**Vercel Benefits:**
- ✅ Native Next.js support (no configuration needed)
- ✅ Automatic deployments on git push
- ✅ Free hosting
- ✅ Better performance than GitHub Pages
- ✅ No build configuration needed

## Option 3: Fix Build & Deploy to GitHub Pages

Once the build issues are resolved:
1. Run `npm run build`
2. The `out` folder will contain static files
3. Push the `out` folder contents to your `gh-pages` branch

---

**For now, your Next.js portfolio works perfectly at `http://localhost:3001` locally.**

Would you like me to:
1. Fix the build issues now?
2. Set up Vercel deployment?
3. Create a GitHub Actions workflow that will work?
