# 🚀 Deployment Guide - GitHub Pages

Your Next.js portfolio build is **successful** and ready for deployment!

## ✅ Build Status

✅ Build completed successfully  
✅ Static pages generated  
✅ Ready for GitHub Pages deployment  

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Next.js portfolio ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/syal00/syal00.github.io`
2. Click on **Settings**
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Automatic Deployment

- GitHub Actions will automatically:
  - ✅ Build your Next.js app
  - ✅ Generate static files
  - ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages
  
- The workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) will run automatically on every push to `main`

### Step 4: Access Your Site

After deployment completes (usually 1-2 minutes):
- Visit: **https://syal00.github.io/**

## 📝 Important Notes

### ✅ What Works:
- ✅ All pages and components
- ✅ Static content
- ✅ Images and assets
- ✅ Blog posts (fetched at build time)
- ✅ Contact form (opens email client)

### ⚠️ Limitations (GitHub Pages Static Export):
- ❌ API routes (removed - not supported in static export)
- ❌ Server-side features
- ❌ Dynamic server rendering

### 🔧 Contact Form:
The contact form now uses:
- **Mailto link** (opens default email client)
- Can be upgraded to EmailJS (instructions in code)

## 🔄 Future Updates

Every time you push to `main`:
1. GitHub Actions automatically builds
2. Deploys updated site
3. Site updates within 1-2 minutes

## 🎉 Your Portfolio is Ready!

Your Next.js portfolio is now configured and ready to deploy to GitHub Pages!

**Next Steps:**
