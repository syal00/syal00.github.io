# Fix GitHub Pages Deployment

Your Next.js portfolio works on localhost but not on the live site. Here's how to fix it:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Root Cause

GitHub Pages is likely still configured to serve files from a **branch** instead of **GitHub Actions**. This means it's serving the old static files instead of your new Next.js build.

## ‚úÖ Solution

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Actions as Source

1. Go to: https://github.com/syal00/syal00.github.io/settings/pages
2. Under **"Source"**:
   - Select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
   - If you see "Deploy from a branch" selected, change it to "GitHub Actions"
3. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Verify Workflow Status

1. Go to: https://github.com/syal00/syal00.github.io/actions
2. Check if there's a workflow run:
   - ‚úÖ **Green checkmark** = Build successful, deploying
   - ‚ùå **Red X** = Build failed (check logs)
   - ‚è≥ **Yellow circle** = In progress

### Step 3: Check Deployment Status

After enabling GitHub Actions:
- Wait 2-5 minutes for the workflow to complete
- Once deployed, your site will be live at: https://syal00.github.io/

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If the workflow is failing:
1. Click on the failed workflow run
2. Check the "build" job logs
3. Look for error messages (the improved logging will show what went wrong)

### If the workflow succeeds but site doesn't update:
1. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Wait a few more minutes (GitHub Pages can take time to propagate)

## üìã What We've Done

‚úÖ Removed old static HTML/CSS files
‚úÖ Configured Next.js for static export
‚úÖ Created GitHub Actions workflow
‚úÖ Added build verification and logging
‚úÖ Fixed dependency installation

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Enable GitHub Actions** in Pages settings (Step 1 above)
2. **Wait for deployment** (check Actions tab)
3. **Visit** https://syal00.github.io/ to see your Next.js portfolio!

The workflow will automatically deploy after each push to the main branch once GitHub Actions is enabled.
